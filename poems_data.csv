reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart.
You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that
youare broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes
near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples
falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness.
Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could.

— Louise Erdrich
 life will break you nobody can protect you from that and living alone wont either for solitude will also break you with its yearning you have to love you have to feel it is the reason you are here on earth you are here to risk your heart you are here to be swallowed up and when it happens that you are broken or betrayed or left or hurt or death brushes near let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps wasting their sweetness tell yourself you tasted as many as you could louise erdrich"

When the doctor suggested surgery
and a brace for all my youngest years,
my parents scrambled to take me

to massage therapy, deep tissue work,
osteopathy, and soon my crooked spine
unspooled a bit, I could breathe again,
and move more in a body unclouded
by pain. My mom would tell me to sing
songs to her the whole forty-five minute
drive to Middle Two Rock Road and forty-
five minutes back from physical therapy.

She'd say, even my voice sounded unfettered

by my spine afterward. So I sang and sang,
because I thought she liked it. I never

asked her what she gave up to drive me,

or how her day was before this chore. Today,
at her age, I was driving myself home from yet
another spine appointment, singing along
to some maudlin but solid song on the radio,
and I saw a mom take her raincoat off

and give it to her young daughter when

a storm took over the afternoon. My god,

I thought, my whole life I’ve been under her
raincoat thinking it was somehow a marvel
that I never got wet.

where to find the brightest,
most exacting love.

Much of it burns off.

What remains, remains.

Improbably I fell in love with your assistant.

Your chair stood in the apartment and he sat in it

Symbolically. You were everywhere.

In spring we watched you speak from a projection screen

And I cried never having known you, and in summer

We lived in your house. In your pool

We taught a boy to swim. In your Hamptons we ate lobsters
And cinnamon ice cream, walked in the sand bought wine made
Love only a few times but I would not notice

For months we were finished, so intent was I on honoring you.
You’d written and yet, and yet on the collage

So we felt your whole life and death in the house there

With us. I followed the instructions you left and did not break
The espresso machine, and fuss now over my own as if

Over a steam-sighing relict angel. You watched over us!

I felt your breath upon me in that house, it is upon me now.

Dear Life

I can’t undo all I have done unto myself,
what I have let an appetite for love do to me.

I have wanted all the world, its beauties
and its injuries; some days,
I think that is punishment enough.

Often, I received more than I’d asked,

which is how this works—you fish in open water
ready to be wounded on what you reel in.

Throwing it back was a nightmare.
Throwing it back and seeing my own face

as it disappeared into the dark water.

Catching my tongue suddenly on metal,
spitting the hook into my open palm.

Dear life: I feel that hook today most keenly.
Would you loosen the line—you'll listen
if I ask you,

if you are the sort of life I think you are.

case. Anyway, whatever it is, don’t be afraid
of its plenty. Joy is not made to be a crumb.
 dont hesitate if you suddenly and unexpectedly feel joy dont hesitate give into it there are plenty of lives and whole towns destroyed or about to be we are not wise and not very often kind and much can never be redeemed still life has some possibility left perhaps this is its way of fighting back that sometimes something happens better than all the riches or power in the world it could be anything but very likely you notice it in the instant when love begins any way that soften the case anyway whatever it is dont be afraid of its plenty joy is not made to be a crumb"

I think people are so beautiful
when their eyes light up and they say sincerely,
“T’m so glad you’re here.”

In other words,
you bring joy to my life.
You bring relief in rooms
I am struggling in.
You bring me hope
when I need it most.
You make the world
a little bit easier to live in.
Thank you for existing.
I love you for making me feel better.
I’m so glad you're here.

Nikita Gill

Do not care if you bring only your light body.
Would just be so happy to sit at the table
and talk about the menu. Miss you.

Wish we could bet which chilis they'll put
on the cubes of tofu. Our favorite.
Sometimes green. Sometimes red. Roasted
we always thought. But so cold and fresh.
How did they do it? Wish you could be here

could get out of the hospital. Can’t

bring myself to order our dish and eat it

like. You can come in your light

Light clarity avocado salad in the morning

after all the terrible things I do how amazing it is

to find forgiveness and love, not even forgiveness

since what is done is done and forgiveness isn’t love
and love is love nothing can ever go wrong

though things can get irritating boring and dispensable
(in the imagination) but not really for love

though a block away you feel distant the mere presence
changes everything like a chemical dropped on a paper
and all thoughts disappear in a strange quiet excitement
I am sure of nothing but this, intensified by breathing

plishment. I can’t play for anyone else. I’ve failed to learn the
